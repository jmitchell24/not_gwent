This is a personal project I started in Summer 2023. 

The goal was to re-create the gwent mini-game from [Witcher 3](https://www.thewitcher.com/us/en/witcher3)

The project is currently on hiatus. 

A notable feature of the game engine is the tooling. 

I built a feature-rich 2D layout editor that enabled me to change ui elements in realtime.
